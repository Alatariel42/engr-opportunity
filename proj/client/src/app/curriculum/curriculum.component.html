    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        Our structured workshops are our ideal choice when we can have a classroom like setting for a workshop.
        In this, a lead volunteer leads groups through building one of our robots.
        Typically, students work in groups of 2-4 together on communication skills, building a robot, and programming their robot.
        Additional volunteers walk around assisting individual groups with any problems they face and to talk to individuals about their interests.

      <h2>Unstructured Workshops</h2>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        We also have unstructured workshops available as not every workshop is ideal for structured workshops.
        Unstructured workshops pair one of our volunteers with an individual or small group (1 volunteer to 1-3 students).
        This allows our volunteers to give individualized instruction and to cater the lesson to individuals of different ages and levels of experience.

      <h3>Basic Bot</h3>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        This is an effective introductory bot for new students.
        It is typically used as a project for younger students. 
        It can also be used as a programming bot for older students and is also used as the base for more complex bots.
        Some of our programming lessons involve basic navigation, autonomous navigation, light detection, and more.

        In extended lessons, we can also discuss design choices, stability, ability to turn, and potential improvements.
        Additionally, students are given trhe opportunity to personalize their robot.

      <h3>Transport Bot</h3>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        This is a good second robot to build.
        This bot can move in all directions and can carry around small items such as candy and trinkets.
        This bot uses the BasicBot as its core build.
        Make sure you have built the BasicBot BEFORE building the TransportBot.
        All programming lessons in for the Basic Bot are applicable to the transport bot, as well as transporting items from one area to another.

      <h3>Four Wheeler Bot</h3>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        This is a more complex robot with four wheels.
        It is made to be easily extensible.
        Like the basic bot, it can be used as a project for younger students, as a programming bot for older students, and as the base for more complex bots.
        This is best suited for longer workshops where students will have time to build the bot and explore extending it themselves or in one of our other lessons.
        Extensions could involve additional sensors or aesthetic changes.

      <h3>Making Smores</h3>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        This lesson is intended to introduce students to algorithmic thinking and other introductory computer science concepts.
        A volunteer has all of the required parts to create smores out on the table, and asks the students to tell them how to make smores.
        The volunteer then follows the steps from the students <strong>exactly</strong> as described.
        If a student tells our volunteer to "put the chocolate on the grame cracker" the volunteer will place the container of chocolate spread on top of the graham crackers.
        Students will be guided to give very exact instructions, just as computers must be given

      <h3>Smart Paper</h3>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        This is an additional introductory lesson to show students how algorithms work in practice, but still without touching a computer.
        This was created by Paul Curzon of Queen Mary University of London.
        Our volunteer announces that they have a highly intelligent piece of paper. This piece of paper is undefeated in tic-tac-to.
        It was always win or tie. Students attempt to defeat the paper, but are unable to.
        The volunteer can then project or pass around the piece of paper, revealing that the set of steps that cannot be defeated.

      <h3>Basic Motion</h3>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        This is an introductory programming lesson to show students the basics of how simple algorithms can make the robot move.
        Much like simply pressing buttons on the remote, the lesson accomplishes motion without sensors or loops by sending move commands in a variety of directions.
        Students can also see how the programming language allows you to tune the motion much more finely, allowing for different speeds, steering, and more than two motors.

      <h3>Colors</h3>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        This is an introductory programming lesson to introduce students to sensors. This can be related to real life scenarios, such as traffic lights.
        Students are taught the basics of how a color sensor works, connect the color sensor to their bot, and learn how to make the robot move until the saensor picks up a certain color.

      <h3>Lights</h3>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        This is another introductory programming lesson showing students the basics of sensors. Students see how a color sensor can also be used to detect the intensity of a light.
        This can be related to real life scenarios, such as light nights that only turn on when it is dark in order to save energy. In this lesson, students create a bot that only moves when there is light shining on it.

      <h3>Autonomous Motion</h3>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        This is a more advanced programming lesson. Students combine censors, loops, and conditionals in order to make a bot that is able to navigate around a room on its own.
        This can be related to a robotic vacuum that makes its way around the room vacuuming debris. The bot moves forward until it is near an obstacle, then backs up and turns slightly.
