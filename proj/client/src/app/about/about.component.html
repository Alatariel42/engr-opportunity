      <h2>How We Started</h2>
    </mat-card-title>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        Our founders were fortunate enough to be exposed to fun STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) activities throughout their education and they had the resources to attend after school clubs and competitions. This helped them discover their passions and guide their educational choices. However, not everyone is fortunate enough to be exposed to STEAM activities. These activities cost school systems money, and often these programs are cut when budgets come under scrutiny. Additionally, transportation is often a barrier, as not everyone is able to get a ride home from school if they attend an after school club or activity instead of getting on the bus.
